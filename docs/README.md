- App is currently optimized to be a PWA, works
- Having consistency issues with ChatScope rendering; May be issues with Safari, since they're not seen in Chrome
- Chat updates properly real-time, chats are properly stored in Supabase
- Payment processing schema migrations in Supabase are underway (trying to figure out a proper safe architecture)
- Marketing is in the works
